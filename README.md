# Vehicle Tracking with YOLOv8 and OpenCV

This project implements a vehicle detection and tracking system using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and a custom tracking algorithm. The system processes video input, detects vehicles, and tracks them across frames.

## Features

- Uses YOLOv8 for real-time object detection.
- Tracks vehicles using a custom tracking algorithm.
- Annotates the video frames with bounding boxes and unique IDs for each detected vehicle.
- Displays real-time mouse position over the video.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure that the following dependencies are installed.

## Installation 
1. run pip install - r requirements.txt
2. Download footage from download.txt, and extract it the same folder
3. Run and debug main.py

This code is based on a tutorial video. All credit for the original concept and approach goes to the creator of the video. This project serves as an educational follow-along implementation.
